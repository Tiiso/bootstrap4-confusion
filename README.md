# bootstrap4-confusion
This is a series of assignment that I have completed through a Coursera course: Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4. A lot of topics were discussed in this course and I can confidently take on any bootstrap challenge any day anytime. 
It has added up on my initial bootstrap knowledge.
So far this is what I have learnt: 
Bootstrap
– Responsive	Design	and	Bootstrap	Grid	System
– Bootstrap	CSS	and	JavaScript	Components
• Web	Tools:
– Git
– Node.js and	NPM
– Grunt	
And I am yet to learn Gulp.

I have ran into this issue with usemin while busy with Grunt: 
throw new JS_Parse_Error(message, filename, line, col, pos);
    ^
SyntaxError: Unexpected token: punc ({)
    at JS_Parse_Error.get (eval at <anonymous> (C:\Users\User\Documents\coursera\Bootstrap4\conFusion\node_modules\usemin\node_modules\uglify-js\tools\node.js:27:1), <anonymous>:86:23)
